# PoC / OVHcloud product map

Another way to display OVHcloud products !
Personal proof of concept, unrelated to our CX/UX Designers Teams. That's why it's ugly.


## See in action

Just go to [https://www.product-map.ovh/](https://www.product-map.ovh/)

## Request a modification on a product information

Please create a pull request directly on this repository, thanks !

## Generate yourself

Download the code, install requirements (Jinja2 and Pandas only) then run Python code **generate.py**.

That's all, output is in *output* folder.

Comments, feedback : use Github or reach me on Twitter / @BastienOVH

Have fun.
